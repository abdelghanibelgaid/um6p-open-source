## Notes

- Prefer **one primary domain** per project.  
- If your software clearly spans multiple domains, choose the **closest fit** here and use the `tags` field for extra nuance (e.g., `remote-sensing; agriculture; quantum`).
- To propose a new domain, please open an issue, and suggest the new domain value, a short description, and a couple of example projects.
